# Analysis

## Environment Setup

First, use the `environment.yml` file to set up your python environment. Any version of Python roughly 3.6 or later should be fine, but we didn't test that rigourosly (we are currently using 3.9 and will upgrade to 3.10 when it comes out). Next, install all the submodules in `modules/` into your python environment (they are modified versions of pypi packages).
